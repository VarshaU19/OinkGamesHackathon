Hello! I am Varsha and I am taking part in the 2026 OinkGames Hackathon! 
I have created a game using the theme "Pigs"

The goal of the game is to catch all the falling corn without falling off the platform and missing a corn
This game is built using Python and the Pygame library

I hope you love the game as much as I loved building it!
